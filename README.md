# AoC-2019
Here are my messy solutions to the 2019 Advent of Code.  
I'm new to coding and I'm trying to use these problems to get better in python...

Really struggled with this day. Ended up re-writing the solution ~5 times.  
In the end I just wasn't being rigorous enough with my tracking of leftover materials

## Day 15
This one was fun for me. I spent some extra time trying to plot everything and have it animate as the robot moved through the maze.  
I first started with a random robot who just chose a random direction every step. This worked as I eventually mapped the whole maze but it took 750,000 steps!  
Next I decided to use the age old technique of following a wall. This was way more efficient and the whole maze was mapped in around 3000 steps. Once I knew I could map the maze I implemented a counting algorithm to count the number of steps the robot currently was from the start. Finally using these counts I traced the robots path backwards from the O2 system following the decreasing step count.
## Day 16
Today was pretty straight forward as long as you started small and made sure you had everything accounted for. Solution easily scaled up.
## Day 17
Another use of the intcode computer!  
This time we ran a program to produce a series of overlapping lines where we had to determine the locations of each of the intersections. Just using some plotting and some simple checks was enough to solve part 1.
